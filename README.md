# Pong-Game

Pong is a much more complex game.

First, we're going to figure out how to create the screen,how to create and move a puddle, and then create another puddle so we can have a two-player game and then create the ball and make it move constantly across the screen and figure out when it collides with a wall and make it bounce back and then detect when there's a collision with the paddle to know when to bounce it back. Finally, we'll figure out when a user scores, when the paddle misses the ball, and we'll keep the score using a scoreboard.
